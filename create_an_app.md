To do this, you need to:
* Create or go to your facebook developer account at [developers.facebook.com.](https://developers.facebook.com)
* Create a new facebook app.
  * Input a **valid contact email.**
  * Choose a **category.**
  * Click on "Skip Quick Start".
  * Then go back to the **Dashboard.**
* Choose **messenger platform** on the left, on the dashboard menu.
* Select page from your account, then facebook will generate an __Access Token__.

In the nezt step of setting up webhook, you would be shown how to use your access Token that was generated for you and also how to subscribe.
