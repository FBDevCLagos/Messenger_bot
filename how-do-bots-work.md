# How do BotsÂ work?

Chat bots are conversational agents. 
At the barest minimum a bot accepts messages and replies with messages or actions. The advantage that bots have over other platforms(mobile apps, websites) is that they allow us to interact with our users in a conversational style which is how humans operate in the real world. Since humans invented language, we have expressed ourselves in a conversational style. Now chat bots have caught up with us and they want to talk to all of us. Facebook Messenger Platform allows you to build bots for the messenger platform. Why should you? Facebook Messenger has reached 1.2 billion monthly active users.
## Facebook Messenger Platform
A bot on the Facebook messenger platform is simply a server side application that responds to incoming requests from Facebook. Messenger Platform provides supports for numerous content types including text, image, video, audio.
