When my Mentor Oscar Oranagwa asked me to write about bots, I decided to use this opportunity to clarify exactly on what bots
are, to both my fellow developers as well as any newbie with the desire to benefit from this innovation. I will use a story
to explain it all to an extent but before that, let me begin with;

WHAT ARE BOTS?
BOTS are also known as Internet Robots, and just as the name Robot implies; Bots make things easier, they can handle 
repetitive tasks and many more. Formerly, the popular version of bots came in the form of malware, but that has begun 
to change with tech companies like Facebook, Telegram, Chatfuel providing a more useful version of this technology, 
and they represent CHAT BOTS.

WHY ARE THEY SO IMPORTANT?
Now let me tell you a story about ChatBots and how they came to be in this ever growing internet generation, evolving gradually 
to this stage, gathering momentum as it approaches this point.
In the beginning was Mr.Internet, the current King of transmitting information, who ruled with greatness, knowledge and love, 
and basically has a lot of tricks under his sleeve. One day, he realized an organizational problem in his kingdom, and since
he is a big fan of delegating and organizing, he appoints worthy Knights to handle this problem, Knighthood meaning Websites.
So this was where Facebook, Google, Twitter and the rest came in.
Now these improved the situation in the Kingdom, and things were awesome and his Kingdom (Information) grew larger, and as it 
grew, things became disorganized once more, and so Mr.Internet called for meeting, discussed the problem and came up with a 
solution. He said "Why don't you have your own specific kingdoms and territories and mansions where you can receive your guests"
and they all agreed to this, and then he gave them a condition saying "But you must call these territories, APPS ". And they 
were all cool with it and new knights joined their crusade (Whatsapp, SnapChat and the rest), Now things became more cool and 
and everyone was happy.
One day, the King took a trip and when he finally got back, he noticed a new disorganization problem, this time there were
so many territories, and mansions scattered all over the place, relevant and irrelevant, and he was not happy with this. And so 
he called a meeting and stated this problem saying "Why is every Knight building a mansion or territory for every single 
purpose when he can just have a room for it. In fact, why can't it be like a mall where you can find all you need. If a person 
visits Mansion A to buy cereal, why go to another Mansion B to buy Milk. Why can't Mansion B simply sell his Milk at Mansion A." 
"You don't have to travel all around my kingdom to get what you want" he said. And that was how Bots were formed.
And so Facebook, a great knight whom is popular for having visitors offered to share visitors with any Knight whom came to 
hang out in their mansion (messenger platform). And by visitors I mean about 1 billion users a day.
THIS IS WHY CHAT BOTS ARE IDEAL FOR YOUR IDEA AND BUSINESS. They are the new apps with a currently emerging market, where big 
tech companies are currently competing for share of this market. So even as a developer or entrepreneur, you need to realize that 
Bots have huge potentials.
